# MoneyWise Security Audit Configuration
# Overrides for transitive dependencies that cannot be easily updated

# Temporary audit level override for CI/CD
# These vulnerabilities are from Expo/React Native transitive dependencies
# and are not directly exploitable in our application context:
#
# 1. semver@7.3.2 (GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw) - Deep in Expo CLI toolchain
# 2. ip@1.1.9 (GHSA-2p57-rm9w-gvfp) - React Native CLI development tools
# 3. esbuild@0.21.5 (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99) - Vite/Vitest dev dependency
# 4. webpack-dev-server@4.15.2 (GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h, GHSA-4v9v-hfq4-rm2v) - Expo webpack config
#
# These are development-only dependencies that don't affect production runtime security.
# To be addressed when Expo SDK updates become available.
