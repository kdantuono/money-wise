## 🎯 Documentation Philosophy

1. **Reality-Based**: Document what exists, not what's planned
2. **Developer-Focused**: Optimized for newcomer onboarding and daily development
3. **Living Documents**: Updated alongside code changes
4. **Just Enough**: Comprehensive but not overwhelming

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Read [`money-wise-overview.md`](./money-wise-overview.md) for project context
2. Follow [`development/setup.md`](./development/setup.md) for environment setup
3. Review [`mvp_eng_plan.md`](./mvp_eng_plan.md) for implementation phases
4. Check [`development/`](./development/) for current progress
