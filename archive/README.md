# MoneyWise Archive

> **Purpose**: Preserve valuable code that's beyond MVP scope but has future potential **Created**: 2025-01-19 during
> MVP cleanup process **Status**: Archived for future integration

## 📁 Archive Structure

### `infrastructure/`

**Broken/unused infrastructure configurations**

- Docker configurations with path mismatches and reliability issues
- GitLab CI/CD configuration (project uses GitHub Actions)
- Excess GitHub workflows (14 → 3 simplified workflows)

### `agent-orchestration/`

**Advanced multi-agent development system**

- 17 orchestration scripts with sophisticated TDD automation
- Agent cluster definitions (AI Intelligence, Event Streaming, Notification Engine)
- Session management and tmux coordination
- **Value**: Excellent concepts for future large-scale development
- **Why Archived**: Over-engineered for MVP, broken session management

### `advanced-features/`

**High-quality features beyond MVP scope**

- ML transaction categorization (complete AI infrastructure)
- Real-time notification system
- WebSocket event streaming
- Advanced authentication (MFA, social auth)
- **Value**: Enterprise-grade features for future product evolution
- **Why Archived**: Exceed MVP scope, add unnecessary complexity

### `documentation/`

**Advanced workflow and orchestration documentation**

- Multi-agent workflow guides
- CI/CD restructuring documentation
- Agent orchestration methodology
- **Value**: Reference for future development process optimization

## 🔄 Future Integration
