# Backups Directory
#
# This directory stores automated backups created during CI/CD infrastructure updates
# and maintenance operations. Backups are automatically cleaned up after successful
# updates, with the 3 most recent backups retained for safety.
#
# Structure:

# - cache-YYYY-MM-DD/               # Cache state backups
