# MoneyWise - Performance Benchmarks

This is the `gh-pages` branch that stores performance benchmark data for MoneyWise API.

## Directory Structure

```
data/
├── main/              # Production branch benchmarks (main)
├── develop/           # Staging branch benchmarks (develop)
└── trends/            # Historical performance trends
```

## Benchmark Storage

Performance benchmarks are automatically generated and stored on each successful CI/CD pipeline run:

- **Main Branch**: Baseline production performance metrics
- **Develop Branch**: Pre-release staging environment metrics
- **Trends**: Historical data for performance regression detection

## How It Works

1. **Performance Tests Run**: `pnpm test:performance` executes API endpoint benchmarks
2. **Formatter Converts**: `format-benchmarks.js` converts Jest output to JSON
3. **GitHub Actions Stores**: `benchmark-action` saves results to `gh-pages` branch
4. **Dashboard Displays**: Metrics available at `https://<owner>.github.io/money-wise/`

## Data Format

Benchmark results are stored as JSON:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "POST /auth/login (ms)",
    "unit": "ops/sec",
    "value": 6.9
  },
  {
    "name": "GET /auth/profile (ms)",
    "unit": "ops/sec",
    "value": 10.15
  }
]
```

Higher values = better performance (operations per second)

## Metrics Tracked

- **Authentication**: login, register, profile endpoints
- **Accounts**: list, create, retrieve operations
- **Transactions**: list, create operations
- **Concurrent Requests**: multi-user load testing

## Performance Thresholds

Alert thresholds are configured in the CI/CD workflow:
- P95 response times must be ≤ threshold for each endpoint
- Failures trigger GitHub issue comments on PRs
- Non-blocking to prevent valid features from merging due to performance variance

## Branches

- `main`: Live production performance
- `develop`: Pre-release staging metrics
- `feature/*`: Temporary feature branch runs (not stored)
